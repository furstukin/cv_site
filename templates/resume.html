							<h4><b>Senior Manager and Head of BI</b></h4>
							PGT Innovations<br>
							Jun 2022 - Jan 2025<br>
							Venice, Florida, United States<br>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I ran the business intelligence department for PGTI reviewing options and implementing BI infrastructure that was non-existent at the time. I worked with IT leadership to determine our best course based on existing talent and resources. This led me to go with DOMO as a BI solution since it provided an all-in-one self-managed service that met all our data and BI needs. I then worked with my team of BI developers and data engineers to capture and consolidate the sales and order data across all 10 brands in the company. This involved merging data from 7 different ERPs to provide the first ever view of operations and sales across the entire corporation. I created an HR chatbot capable of answering questions about employee policy and designed a data model to train ML models on how to predict quote conversions. When we were purchased by MITER, I provided insights into their use of PBI, allowing them to better utilize their capacity and identify the areas that were running inefficiently. I also introduced them to the Microsoft Fabric infrastructure implemented around PBI in the last year, ensuring they are aware of, and can take advantage of, all the new tools and features that come with Fabric.

							<h4><b>Business Intelligence Manager</b></h4>
							FIS<br>
							May 2020 - Jun 2022<br>
							Jacksonville, Florida, United States<br>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I worked as a manager for the TechDev Business Intelligence group at FIS. I oversaw a team of data specialists, managed the data strategy, Power BI (PBI) workspaces, report deployment pipeline, SharePoint, and executive report development. As part of an ongoing data improvement effort, I worked directly with executive leadership to identify gaps in both processes and systems. I then worked with stakeholders and data stewards to close the gaps allowing for better utilization of data and better business intelligence solutions. My efforts helped change the way TechDev used data and measured the key metrics for our Chief Technology Officer. Additionally, I was a key leader helping to drive adoption of SAFe within TechDev BI.

							<h4><b>IT Business Systems and Business Intelligence Consultant</b></h4>
							Bank of the West · Contract<br>
							Sep 2019 - May 2020<br>
							Omaha, NE, United States<br>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I was contracted with Bank of the West to manage the IT Service Operations data, reporting, and business intelligence needs. I was brought in to find ways to connect data from various systems to provide the combined data, reports and dashboards that are needed by the various departments in IT Operations to make effective business decisions. The data comes from multiple sources and in multiple forms, which requires me to create data models within Power BI and use ETL techniques to generate compatible data tables. As a result, I work with SQL Servers, Oracle Databases and raw data files learning the nuances of each group's data so I can effectively account for any discrepancies that arise from those nuances. I then create interactive dashboards for each group that can be accessed on a report server and automatically update daily. In addition, I mentor some of the bank’s existing analysts in proper data modeling and visualization techniques.

							<h4><b>Senior Analyst and Data Manager</b></h4>
							PayPal<br>
							Oct 2016 - Sep 2019<br>
							La Vista, NE, United States<br>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I worked as the senior analyst and data manager for Third Party Management supervising three other team members. I was responsible for the design and oversight of the onboarding process for all new third parties PayPal did business with. This included designing controls to ensure all required due diligence was completed prior to doing business with any third party and creating reports/monitoring to ensure the controls were working. I was also responsible for all due diligence reporting and business intelligence needs, including custom dashboards. I also used visual basic to create tools for other team members to process data, produce automated reports, and load data into the Third Party Management system. In addition, I was responsible for the design and creation of the SharePoint forms that were used by PayPal to submit requests to my team for everything from onboarding a new third party to asking for a custom report.

							<h4><b>HR Operations Business Analyst and Process Manager</b></h4>
							First Data Corporation<br>
							Mar 2015 - Oct 2016<br>
							Omaha, NE, United States<br>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I worked in the HR Operations department as a compliance business analyst and process manager where I supervised four other analysts. I oversaw multiple processes including severance, employee terminations, payroll entries, timecard approvals, overpayments, security role access, and internal audit findings. In addition, I was the sole VBA developer for our area, so I worked on multiple process improvement projects automating the manual and tedious processes currently being used. I also designed new company-wide reports and created the auditing processes for HR Operations. This included overpayment tracking, time sheet approval compliance, bonus requests and tracking, leave accruals, severance auditing, and segregation of PeopleSoft Security Roles. I was also called upon to act as the SharePoint developer for HR Operations and designed several new sites and custom coding to suit their needs.

							<h4><b>Intern, Business Intelligence Developer</b></h4>
							Securities America, Inc.<br>
							Oct 2013 - Dec 2014<br>
							La Vista, NE, United States<br>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I was offered this internship as part of the scholarship I was awarded in 2013. While working for Securities America it was quickly discovered I was very skilled with data analysis and programming. This has essentially turned my job into that of a BI developer. My main tasks are to work with upper management from all departments to find ways of simplifying data processes and reduce the manual effort needed to analyze large sets of data. I am also often asked to find ways to extract, transform, and load data from several legacy systems into one easy to follow report. One of the things I enjoy most is being asked to design Access databases from scratch to develop and generate the kind of historical data needed for proper reporting to the SEC and FINRA. Recently I have even taken over the task of generating custom reports and queries in our Human Resources training system until we can hire a replacement. As a result, I have been asked to find ways to make the system produce very simple, user friendly, reports that the next person can pick up with little to no training required.

							<h4><b>Operation Services Business Intelligence Analyst</b></h4>
							West Corporation<br>
							Mar 2010 - Sep 2013<br>
							Omaha, NE, United States<br>
							<hr>
							<p>
								As a business intelligence analyst I was responsible for a wide variety of projects that involved all visual basic programming needs, collection of data from various sources, regression analysis of past data, report development, data scrubbing, data merging, and general spreadsheet design. To better support their needs our client purchased a single copy of Tableau that was licensed exclusively to me. Along with Tableau I was given access to the client’s Crystal Reports system to be able to back up their Senior Manager while he was away on business. In addition to those responsibilities I handled general project management for the client and supervised all the lines of business the junior analysts from our team had worked with. This often required me to work on and prioritize several projects at once that often dealt with vastly different products. Finally I provided Excel, Access, and VBA support as needed to the client and the rest of our team.
